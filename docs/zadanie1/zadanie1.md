# TIOBE Index for March 2025

### March Headline: The dinosaurs strike back


It is interesting to see that very old languages are sneaking into the TIOBE index top 20. Fortran and Delphi are competing for a top 10 position, whereas COBOL and this month's new entry Ada are a little bit further down the list. All of them show an uptrend. Why is this? Why aren't the new and promising languages shining instead?


I think that it has to do with the many vital legacy systems that keep the world running. Most of them are developed with the aid of these dinosaur languages. Now that the last of the core developers of these systems are about to retire, companies avoid any risk and choose to keep the existing systems and even extend them rather than replacing them by newer systems based on more modern languages. Note that we name these languages dinosaurs, but they have evolved over time and are pretty up to date. All of them have new language definitions. Check out Fortran 2023, Delphi 12 (released in 2024), Ada 2023 and COBOL 2023. We might frown to see these languages being in the TIOBE index top 20, but they definitely serve a purpose and deserve credit.

The TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming 
languages. The index is updated once a month. The ratings are based on the number of 
skilled engineers world-wide, courses and third party vendors. Popular web sites
Google, Amazon, Wikipedia, Bing and more than 20 others are used to calculate the ratings.
It is important to note that the TIOBE index is not about the best programming language or the language
in which most lines of code have been written.

The index can be used to check whether your programming skills are still up to date or to make a 
strategic decision about what programming language should be adopted when starting to build a new 
software system. The definition of the TIOBE index can be found here.

## Very Long Term History


To see the bigger picture, please find below the positions of the top 10 programming languages of many years back. Please note that these are average positions for a period of 12 months.

| Programming Language | 2025 | 2020 | 2015 | 2010 | 2005 | 2000 | 1995 | 1990 | 1985 |
|--------------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Python | 1 | 3 | 7 | 7 | 7 | 24 | 23 | - | - |
| C++ | 2 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 13 |
| C | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 1 |
| Java | 4 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | - | - | - |
| C# | 5 | 5 | 5 | 6 | 9 | 10 | - | - | - |
| JavaScript | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 7 | - | - | - |
| Go | 7 | 15 | 36 | 184 | - | - | - | - | - |
| Visual Basic | 8 | 18 | 234 | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| SQL | 9 | 9 | - | - | 100 | - | - | - | - |
| Fortran | 10 | 30 | 31 | 24 | 15 | 18 | 5 | 3 | 12 |
| PHP | 13 | 8 | 6 | 3 | 5 | 27 | - | - | - |
| Ada | 24 | 36 | 30 | 27 | 16 | 17 | 7 | 6 | 3 |
| Lisp | 27 | 31 | 19 | 16 | 14 | 9 | 6 | 5 | 2 |
| Objective-C | 34 | 10 | 3 | 21 | 39 | - | - | - | - |
| (Visual) Basic | - | - | 100 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 7 | 4 |


There are 2 important remarks here:

- There is a difference between "Visual Basic" and "(Visual) Basic" in the table above. Until 2010, "(Visual) Basic" referred to all possible dialects of Basic, including Visual Basic. After some discussion, it has been decided to split "(Visual) Basic" into all its dialects such as Visual Basic .NET, Classic Visual Basic, PureBasic, and Small Basic, just to name a few. Since Visual Basic .NET has become the major implementation of Visual Basic, it is now called "Visual Basic".
- The programming language SQL was added to the TIOBE index in 2018 after somebody pointed out that SQL is Turing Complete. So although this language is very old, it has only a short history in the index.

## Bugs & Change Requests

This is the top 5 of most requested changes and bugs. If you have any suggestions how to improve the index don’t hesitate to send an e-mail to tpci@tiobe.com.

1. Apart from “<language> programming”, also other queries such as “programming with <language>”, “<language> development” and “<language> coding” should be tried out.
2. Add queries for other natural languages (apart from English). The idea is to start with the Chinese search engine Baidu. This has been implemented partially and will be completed the next few months.
3. Add a list of all search term requests that have been rejected. This is to minimize the number of recurring mails about Rails, JQuery, JSP, etc.
4. Start a TIOBE index for databases, software configuration management systems and application frameworks.
5. Some search engines allow to query pages that have been added last year. The TIOBE index should only track those recently added pages.

### Am I allowed to show the TIOBE index in my weblog/presentation/publication?

Yes, the only condition is to refer to its original source “www.tiobe.com”.

### How may I nominate a new language to be added to the TIOBE index?

If a language meets the criteria of being listed (i.e. it is Turing complete and has an own Wikipedia entry that indicates that it concerns a programming language) and it is sufficiently popular (more than 5,000 hits for +”<language> programming” for Google), then please write an e-mail to tpci@tiobe.com.

### I would like to have the complete data set of the TIOBE index. Is this possible?

We spent a lot of effort to obtain all the data and keep the TIOBE index up to date. In order to compensate a bit for this, we ask a fee of 5,000 US$ for the complete data set. The data set runs from June 2001 till today. It started with 25 languages back in 2001, and now measures more than 150 languages once a month. The data are available in comma separated format. Please contact sales@tiobe.com for more information.

### Why is the maximum taken to calculate the ranking for a grouping, why not the sum?

Well, you can do it either way and both are wrong. If you take the sum, then you get the intersection twice. If you take the max, then you miss the difference. Which one to choose? Suppose somebody comes up with a new search term that is 10% of the original. If you take the max, nothing changes. If you take the sum then the ratings will rise 10%. So taking the sum will be an incentive for some to come up with all kinds of obscure terms for a language. That’s why we decided to take the max.

The proper way to solve this is is of course to take the sum and subtract the intersection. This will give rise to an explosion of extra queries that must be performed. Suppose a language has a grouping of 15 terms, then you have to perform 32,768 queries (all combinations of intersections). So this seems not possible either… If somebody has a solution for this, please let us know.
