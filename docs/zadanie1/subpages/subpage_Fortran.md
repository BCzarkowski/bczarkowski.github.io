# Introduction
Fortran, short for "Formula Translation," is a high-level programming language that was developed in the 1950s, specifically designed for scientific and engineering calculations. The first version, Fortran I, was released by IBM in 1957. It was one of the earliest programming languages to provide a way to express mathematical formulas in a format that was more understandable than assembly language, making it easier for scientists and engineers to write programs.

Fortran introduced several key programming concepts, including the use of variables, loops, and conditionals, which have influenced many subsequent programming languages. Over the years, Fortran has undergone several revisions, leading to the development of Fortran II, III, IV, 77, 90, 95, 2003, and the most recent standard, Fortran 2018. Each version has added new features, such as support for modular programming, object-oriented programming, and parallel computing.

A fun fact about Fortran is that it is still widely used today, particularly in high-performance computing and scientific applications, due to its efficiency in numerical computation and its ability to handle large datasets. Many legacy systems and scientific libraries are written in Fortran, and it remains a popular choice in fields such as climate modeling, computational fluid dynamics, and structural engineering.

## [Fortran - IBM](https://www.ibm.com/history/fortran)

Fortran was born of necessity in the early 1950s, when computer programs were hand-coded. Programmers would laboriously write out rows of zeros and ones in precise order. John Backus, Fortran's primary author, described the process as "hand-to-hand combat with the machine," with the machine often winning. The cost of programmers was ...
