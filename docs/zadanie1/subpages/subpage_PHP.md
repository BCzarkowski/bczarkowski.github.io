# Introduction
PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open-source server-side scripting language designed primarily for web development. It was created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 and released in 1995. Initially, PHP stood for "Personal Home Page," but it was later redefined to reflect its recursive acronym.

PHP is particularly known for its ability to integrate easily with HTML, making it a popular choice for building dynamic web pages. It supports various databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite, and is compatible with numerous web servers, such as Apache and Nginx.

One of the key features of PHP is its simplicity and ease of use, which allows developers to quickly create and deploy web applications. It also supports a wide range of programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

A fun fact about PHP is that it powers a significant portion of the web, with estimates suggesting that around 79% of all websites using server-side scripting languages utilize PHP. Notable platforms built with PHP include WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla, which are among the most popular content management systems globally.

Over the years, PHP has evolved significantly, with major versions introducing new features and improvements. PHP 7, released in December 2015, brought substantial performance enhancements and reduced memory consumption, making it a preferred choice for modern web applications. The language continues to be actively developed, with PHP 8 introducing features like the Just In Time (JIT) compilation and union types, further enhancing its capabilities.
