# Introduction
PHP, which stands for "Hypertext Preprocessor," is a widely-used open-source server-side scripting language designed primarily for web development. It was created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 and released in 1995. Initially, PHP was a set of Common Gateway Interface (CGI) binaries written in the C programming language, but it evolved into a full-fledged scripting language with the release of PHP 3 in 1998.

PHP is particularly known for its ability to integrate seamlessly with HTML, making it a popular choice for building dynamic web pages. It supports various databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite, and is compatible with numerous web servers, such as Apache and Nginx.

One of the key features of PHP is its ease of use, which allows developers to quickly create and deploy web applications. It also supports a wide range of programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

A fun fact about PHP is that it powers a significant portion of the web, with estimates suggesting that over 79% of websites using server-side scripting languages utilize PHP, including major platforms like WordPress, Facebook, and Wikipedia. The language has undergone continuous development, with PHP 8.0, released in November 2020, introducing significant performance improvements and new features like the Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.
