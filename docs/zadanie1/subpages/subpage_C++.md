# Introduction
C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, starting in 1979. It was designed as an extension of the C programming language, incorporating object-oriented features to enhance its capabilities. The first commercial release of C++ was in 1985, and it has since evolved through various standards, with significant updates including C++98, C++03, C++11, C++14, C++17, and C++20.

C++ supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming, making it a versatile choice for a wide range of applications. It is widely used in system/software development, game development, real-time simulations, and performance-critical applications due to its efficiency and control over system resources.

One notable feature of C++ is its Standard Template Library (STL), which provides a collection of template classes and functions for common data structures and algorithms, promoting code reuse and efficiency. C++ also allows for low-level memory manipulation, giving developers fine-grained control over system resources.

A fun fact about C++ is that it has influenced many other programming languages, including C#, Java, and Python, which have adopted various features and concepts from C++. Its enduring popularity is reflected in its continued use in both academic and industrial settings, making it one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.

This is a list of operators in the C and C++ programming languages.. All listed operators are in C++ and lacking indication otherwise, in C as well. Some tables include a "In C" column that indicates whether an operator is also in C. Note that C does not support operator overloading.. When not overloaded, for the operators &&, ||, and , (the comma operator), there is a sequence point after the ...
