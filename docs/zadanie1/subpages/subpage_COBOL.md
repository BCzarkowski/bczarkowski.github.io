# Introduction
COBOL, which stands for Common Business-Oriented Language, is one of the oldest programming languages, created in 1959. It was developed by a committee of experts from the U.S. Department of Defense, with the goal of providing a standardized language for business data processing. COBOL was designed to be readable and self-documenting, using English-like syntax, which made it accessible to non-programmers and business analysts.

The language gained popularity in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly in the banking, insurance, and government sectors, where it was used for applications such as payroll processing, inventory management, and financial reporting. COBOL's ability to handle large volumes of data and its strong support for file handling and record processing contributed to its widespread adoption.

A fun fact about COBOL is that it is still in use today, with many legacy systems running on it. Despite the emergence of newer programming languages, COBOL remains critical for many organizations, particularly in the financial sector, where it is estimated that over 200 billion lines of COBOL code are still operational. This longevity has led to a demand for COBOL programmers, as many of the original developers have retired, creating a skills gap in maintaining and updating these systems.
