# Introduction
Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is closely related to machine code, the binary instructions executed by a computer's CPU. It serves as a symbolic representation of the machine code, allowing programmers to write instructions using human-readable mnemonics instead of binary numbers. Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture, meaning that code written for one type of CPU will not work on another without modification.

The origins of assembly language date back to the early days of computing in the 1940s and 1950s, with the development of the first electronic computers. The first assembly language was created for the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), which was completed in 1945. As computers evolved, so did assembly languages, with various versions emerging to accommodate different hardware architectures.

Assembly language provides a level of control over hardware that higher-level languages do not, making it useful for system programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications. It allows programmers to manipulate hardware directly, manage memory, and optimize performance, which is essential in environments where resources are limited.

A fun fact about assembly language is that it is often used in reverse engineering and malware analysis. Security researchers and analysts frequently study assembly code to understand how software operates at a low level, identify vulnerabilities, and develop countermeasures against malicious software.

Overall, assembly language remains an important tool in the programmer's toolkit, particularly for tasks that require direct hardware interaction and optimization.

In assembly source, the NASM assembler expects operands to be specified as destination, source (Intel syntax) while the gas assembler expects operands to be specified as source, destination (AT&T syntax). The assembler language for the various CPUs (e.g. MC68000, AMD64, ARM, etc.) each specify whether the left operand is source or destination.
