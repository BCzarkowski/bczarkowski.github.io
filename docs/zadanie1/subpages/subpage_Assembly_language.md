# Introduction
Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is closely related to machine code, the binary instructions executed directly by a computer's CPU. It serves as a symbolic representation of a computer's architecture, allowing programmers to write instructions using mnemonics instead of binary numbers, which makes it more readable and easier to understand.

Assembly language was developed in the early 1950s, with the first assembly languages appearing shortly after the introduction of the first electronic computers. The first widely recognized assembly language was created for the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), one of the earliest general-purpose computers.

Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture, meaning that code written for one type of CPU will not work on another without modification. This specificity allows for fine-tuned control over hardware, making assembly language ideal for system programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.

A notable feature of assembly language is its use of labels and directives, which help organize code and manage data. Programmers can manipulate hardware directly, access memory addresses, and optimize performance in ways that higher-level languages do not allow.

Fun fact: The term "assembly language" comes from the process of assembling the code, where an assembler translates the human-readable mnemonics into machine code. Despite the rise of high-level programming languages, assembly language remains relevant for tasks that require direct hardware manipulation, such as operating system kernels, device drivers, and real-time systems.

In assembly source, the NASM assembler expects operands to be specified as destination, source (Intel syntax) while the gas assembler expects operands to be specified as source, destination (AT&T syntax). The assembler language for the various CPUs (e.g. MC68000, AMD64, ARM, etc.) each specify whether the left operand is source or destination.
