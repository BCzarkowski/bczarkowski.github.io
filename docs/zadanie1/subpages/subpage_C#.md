# Introduction
C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative. It was created in the early 2000s, with its first version released in 2000. C# was designed by Anders Hejlsberg and has since evolved through several versions, with significant updates that have introduced features such as generics, language integrated query (LINQ), asynchronous programming, and pattern matching.

C# is known for its simplicity, versatility, and strong type safety, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from web development to game development and enterprise software. It runs on the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which allows for cross-language interoperability within the .NET ecosystem.

One fun fact about C# is that it was influenced by several programming languages, including C++, Java, and Delphi, which contributed to its syntax and features. Additionally, C# has a strong community and extensive libraries, making it a popular choice for developers worldwide. The language continues to evolve, with regular updates that enhance its capabilities and performance, reflecting the changing needs of software development.

## [C Sharp syntax - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_syntax)

This is a feature of C# 9.0. Similar to in scripting languages, top-level statements removes the ceremony of having to declare the Program class with a Main method. Instead, statements can be written directly in one specific file, and that file will be the entry point of the program. Code in other files will still have to be defined in classes.
